# Brand Ranking

In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on Amazon reviews using Apache Hadoop HDFS for storage and Apache Spark with Scala for data preprocessing, followed by sentiment analysis in Python with Spark. The outcome is a new dataset containing sentiment scores for 60 selected brands across various categories: Electronics, Beauty, Clothing, and Home Tools.

## Problem Definition

- Customers find it difficult to choose products from brands in a crowded market with multiple brands offering similar products.

- It is challenging for businesses to keep track of what customers are feeling about the brand compared to others in this competitive market.

## Tools and Libraries

### Apache Hadoop HDFS: 

Utilized for robust storage of large-scale datasets, offering fault tolerance and high availability to ensure reliable data access.

### Apache Spark: 

Used for efficient data preprocessing and analysis, enabling seamless data handling, preprocessing, and sentiment analysis.

### Scala: 

As the primary programming language for data preprocessing, Scala seamlessly integrated with Spark, facilitating effective data manipulation.

### Python: 

Employed in conjunction with Spark for sentiment analysis, Python's versatility and accessibility were leveraged for natural language processing tasks.

### TextBlob: 

A Python library that simplified sentiment analysis by determining sentiment polarity in review texts, aiding in further analysis.

### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): 

Utilized for text preprocessing, particularly for lemmatization of review text, enhancing data quality for analysis.

### Tableau: 

Played a pivotal role in visualizing data post-analysis, enabling clear and insightful data presentation.
